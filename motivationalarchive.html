                <p>A king demands a tax of 1,000 gold coins from each of 10 regions in his nation. The tax collector for each region brings him the requested bag of gold coins at year end. An informant tells the king that one tax collector is cheating and giving coins that are consistently 10% lighter than they should be, but he does not know which collector is cheating. The king knows that one coin should weigh exactly one ounce. How can the king identify the cheat by using a weighing device exactly once? </p>

            <p>There are three boxes, one contains only apples, one contains only oranges, and one contains both apples and oranges. The boxes have been incorrectly labeled such that no label identifies the actual contents of the box it labels. Opening just one box, and without looking in the box, you take out one piece of fruit. By looking at the fruit, how can you immediately label all of the boxes correctly? Which box should you choose from? </p>

            <p>Here's a new routine I'm using to improve the day and read more. It's only an additional 32 minutes in the morning. 1) Read daily affirmations 2) Meditate with <a href='https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app'>Headspace</a> 3) Read for 20min. I plan to try this for a month and will write a deeper post about the results. The reading portion alone will add 21 extra books to your shelf in a year.

            <p>You're trying to crack a three-number dial safe. Without knowing the combination numbers, what is the maximum number of trials required to open the safe? A trial is considered a full three-number combination. There are 40 numbers on this safe. To enter a combination you start with the dial at zero and turn counter-clockwise until the first number, then clockwise back to zero, then clockwise to the second number, then counter-clockwise back to zero, and finally counter-clockwise to the third number. Upon the correct combination, the safe will spring open. </p>
