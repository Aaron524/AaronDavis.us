								<p>	"The act itself becomes the destination , it's not just that there no finish line, it's that you define the finish line."</P>

                                <p> To name its first futuristic looking shoe, "Bowerman liked 'Aztec,' in homage to the 1968 Olympics, which were being held in Mexico City. I liked that, too. Fine, Onitsuka said. The Aztec was born. And then Adidas threated to sue. Adidas already had a new shoe named the 'Azteca Gold.'" Knight continued: "Bowerman took off his ball cap, put it on again, rubbed his face. 'Who was that guy who kicked the shit out of the Aztecs?' he asked. 'Cortez,' I said. He grunted. 'Okay. Let's call it the Cortez.'"

                                <p> "You run and run , mile after mile, and you never quite know why. You tell yourself that you're running towards some goal, chasing some rush, but you really run because the alternative, stopping, scares you to death."</p>

                                <p> "That morning in 1962 I told myself let everyone else call your idea crazy, just keep going. Don't stop, don't even think about stopping until you get there. And don't give much thought to where there is, whatever comes just don't stop."</p>

                                <p> "Don't tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with the results. -Patton"</p>

                                <p> "Business is war without bullets."</p>

                                <p> "Take it or leave it is like 4 of a kind, it's hard to beat."</p>

                                <p> "Life is growth, you grow or you die."</p>

                                <p> "No matter the sport, no matter the human endeavor really, total effort will win people's hearts."</p>

                                <p> "Giving up doesn't mean stopping. Don't ever stop."</p>
