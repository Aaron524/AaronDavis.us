                    <p>"Being in power is like being a lady. If you have to remind people that you are, you aren't."- Margaret Thatcher.</p>
                    <p>In summary then, a leader is someone who identifies and meets the legitimate needs of their people, removes all the barriers, so they can serve the customer. Again, to lead you must serve. </p>
                    <p>In addition, Greg is not here to defend himself, and I try very hard not to talk negatively about those who are not present.</p>
                    <p>In reference to managers - don't surround ourselves with 'yes' people or people like ourselves. In staff meetings, if all them agree with you on everything, then nine of you are probably unnecessary.</p>
                    <p>Leadership that is going to go the distance over the long haul must be built on influence or authority.</p>
                    <p>Love is built on will of intentions plus actions.</p>
                    <p> With the proper will we can choose to love, the verb, which is about identifying and meeting the legitimate needs, not wants of those we lead. When we meet the needs of others, we will, by definition, be called upon to serve and even sacrifice. When we serve and sacrifice for others, we build authority or influence, the 'Law of the Harvest', as Theresa said. And when we build authority with people, then we have earned the right to be called a leader.</p>
                    <p> Most people want to be involved but nobody wants to be committed.</p>
                    <p>Think of how quick we are to forgive ourselves for the blunder and absurdities that creep into our lives. Are we as quick to forgive our neighbors for their blunders and absurdities? You see, we are quick to love ourselves but not so quick to love others.</p>
                    <p> We should publicly praise people and never publicly punish people.</p>
                    <p> How are you able to get everyone to be so enthusiastic on your team? Lou Holtz replied, 'It's really quite simple. I eliminate the ones who aren't.'</p>
                    <p> What we think or believe is, in the end, of little consequence. The only thing of consequence is what we do.</p>
                    <p>Discipline is teaching ourselves to do what is not natural.</p>
                    <p> Now a few degrees may not make much of a difference on a short journey, but for the long journey of life it may well put you in a completely different place.</p>
                    <p>Long ago a man named Syrus said that it's of no profit to have learned well if you neglect to do well.</p>
